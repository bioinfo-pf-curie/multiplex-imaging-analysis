v-0.4dev
NEW FEATURES
  - added a new segmenter (Mesmer), only compatible with singularity profile
  - added compatibility with qptiff format.

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES
  - mergeSegmentation is replaced with two steps. First is stitch flows (merge output from cellpose processes) and second is compute mask (transform merged flows into masks). All that with reduced memory footprint.
  - optimized stitching (less memory and time)

BUG FIXES
  - some output name were incorrectly set (mask name among other)
  - masks were generated in 16bits, it caused some issues with bigger images.
  - resolve memory overflow in quantification (removed unused cache)


v-0.3
SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES
  - output filename are now more consistent between modules

BUG FIXES
  - correct some bugs with metadata transfer
  - force planar configuration to separate (most of our data were not configured correctly)
  - better code documentation
  - refactor code for better naming convention



v-0.2
NEW FEATURES
  - added a split-segmentation-merge flow to the pipeline as to save as much memory as possible

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES
  - metadata are now transferable between input image and output

BUG FIXES
  - updated libraries
  - py file are now executable

DEPRECATED
  - removed environment from profile conda to profile multiconda



v-0.1
NEW FEATURES
